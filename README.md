Simple tool to look for sequences of one genome in another. It looks for
sequences of 4 codons and above, and stops when it stops finding any.

This can be used to see how similar SARS1 is to SARS2, how NL63 and OC43 are
related but more distantly, and how HIV has nothing to do with any of them.

Why compare HIV with these other coronaviruses? There have been a few stories
in the "fake news" recently about SARS2 being an artificial hybrid involving
HIV. This little program is a bit noddy but I see no evidence of that here.
